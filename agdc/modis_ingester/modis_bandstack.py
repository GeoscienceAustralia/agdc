"""
    abstract_bandstack.py - interface for the bandstack class.

    Different types of dataset will have different versions of this
    class, obtained by sub-classing and overriding the abstract methods.

    It is the responsibility of the stack_bands method of the dataset
    object to instantiate the correct subclass.
