"""dbcleanup.py - Script to clean up the test database server.

This script attempts to drop all the temporary test databases on
the test database server. These may be left behind if the test that
creates them is unable to remove them after running for some reason.

It uses the dbutil TESTSERVER object, which can drop databases being
pooled by pgbouncer.

Note that running this script may cause tests currently running to fail
(by dropping their databases out from under them).
