    abstract_dataset.py - interface for the dataset class.

    This abstract class describes the interface between the dataset
    on disk and the rest of the datacube. Datasets that have different
    packaging will have different version of this class. This is done
    by sub-classing the abstract class and overriding the abstract methods.

    It is the responsibility of the open_dataset method of the ingester
    to choose and instantiate the right dataset class for the dataset
    being opened.
