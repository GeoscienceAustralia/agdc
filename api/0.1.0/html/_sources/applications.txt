Bare Soil
+++++++++

Overview
--------

In areas of little vegetation Landsat TM/ETM+ imagery has proven to be very effective in mapping lithologies and weathered
materials including the distribution of iron oxides, clays and silica.

The Enhanced Mineral and Regolith Mapping (aka Bare Soil) application aims to select pixels through time that have a high
bare earth component (i.e. low green and dry vegetation) and from this compile corresponding Surface Reflectance composite
dataset.

The bare soil application workflow can be summarised as:

* identify the relevant fractional cover datasets; and for each dataset
* apply standard Pixel Quality masking to mask out pixel values affected by contiguity issues, saturation issues, cloud and cloud shadow;
* apply additional masking to mask out pixels with an NDVI value (derived from the corresponding Surface Reflectance dataset) outside of the 0.0 - 0.3 range;
* apply additional masking to mask out pixels classified as water by the Water Observations From Space algorithm;
* apply additional masking to mask out pixels whose Fractional Cover / Bare Soil percentage value is outside the 0% - 80% range;
* select the acquisition that represents the maximum value of the Fractional Cover / Bare Soil percentage from the remaining unmasked pixel time series and output a corresponding composite mosaic of:

  * Surface Reflectance;
  * Fractional Cover;
  * Pixel Provenance datasets detailing:

    * the date the selected pixel value was acquired;
    * the satellite that acquired the selected pixel.

Output Products
---------------

Initial continental scale runs (i.e. all of continental Australia covering lat/lon 110/-45 to 155/-10) for all
Landsat 5 & 7 acquisitions have been produced.

Additional targeted outputs, including pixel level statistics and time series band stacks, have been produced for
the following lat/lon cells:

* 120/-20
* 123/-25
* 135/-18
* 142/-22
* 146/-34

Landsat Clean Pixel Mosaic
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Overview
--------

Geoscience Australia makes available a cloud free mosaic of systematically radiometric and geometric accurate Landsat
surface reflectance imagery.  This image is made available to external stakeholders, as well as being used internally by
Geoscience Australia - for example as a backdrop in the
`Sentinel National Bushfire Monitoring System <http://sentinel.ga.gov.au>`_ system.  The current image of choice is
derived from Landsat 5 & 7 data acquired in 2006.

The goal of the Landsat Clean Pixel Mosaic is to provide an automated process where an up-to-date clean pixel mosaic
of, for example, Landsat 8 Surface Reflectance imagery could be produced on a regular basis (e.g. weekly) as the imagery
is acquired by Geoscience Australia.

The Landsat Clean Pixel Mosaic workflow can be summarised as:

* identify the relevant datasets (typically all Landsat 8 Surface Reflectance datasets);
* start with an empty composite mosaic image;
* process each dataset in order of acquisition, most recent first;
* copy all clean (as per the Pixel Quality Assessment of contiguity, saturation, cloud and cloud shadow) pixels from the current dataset where the corresponding pixel in the composite is currently not populated;
* until all pixels in the composite dataset are populated or the supply of datasets is exhausted.

Output Products
---------------

The output is a clean pixel composite image of continental Australia that can be delivered via file (GeoTIFF, ECW, ...) or via web services (OGC WMS/WCS)...

Wetness in the Landscape
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Overview
--------

The Wetness in the Landscape application (WITL) aims to support a deeper understanding of a range of groundwater
issues, including groundwater recharge/discharge processes and, in the longer term, understanding issues of loading
and/or deformation in the landscape.

A key component of the WITL application is the ability to apply a Tasseled Cap Transformation to Landsat Surface
Reflectance data to produce, at least, the Tasseled Cap Wetness Index (TCWI).

As well as the detailed TWCI datasets, statistical summaries of the TWCI data over time are produced.

The WITL application workflow can be summarised as:

* identify the relevant surface reflectance datasets; and for each dataset
* apply standard Pixel Quality masking to mask out pixel values affected by contiguity issues, saturation issues, cloud and cloud shadow;
* apply the Tasseled Cap Transform to the Surface Reflectance dataset to produce the TWCI dataset;
* produce a statistical summary of the TWCI values for each pixel for given time slices within the time period (for example, monthly, quarterly, yearly).

Output Products
---------------

The initial output products will be produced from Landsat 5 & 7 data allowing comparisons of:

* The Lower Darling (lat/lon 140/-36 to 145/-30):

 * 2006-2009; versus
 * 2010-2012

* The Ord River Scheme (lat/lon 127/-18 to 130/-14) 2006-2013:

 * Wet Season (November to March); versus
 * Dry Season (April to October)
