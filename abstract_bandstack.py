    # Interface for the band stack goes here. This is going to be used
    # by the tiling process. Most of the metadata used by the datacube,
    # including that for the tile entries, should be avaiable via the
    # Dataset class. This class just provides the data and any
    # metadata directly relevant to creating the tile contents, i.e. the
    # tile file associated with the tile database entry.
