    abstract_dataset.py - interface for the dataset class.

    This abstract class describes the interface between the dataset

    packaging will have different version of this class. This is done
    by sub-classing the abstract class and overriding the abstract methods.

    It is the responsibility of the open_dataset method of the ingester
    to choose and instantiate the right dataset class for the dataset
